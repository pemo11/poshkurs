This little PowerShell module contains a few functions and classes that I use for my "Advanced PowerShell class" (MS 112).

It is also a kind of model for how to create and deploy a PowerShell module that use many techniques like class definitions in separate psm1 files.

It can be used with Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7.

It is not digital signed.
